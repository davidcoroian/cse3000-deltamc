# GPMC

GPMC is an exact model counter for CNF formulas. The current version of GPMC supports model counting, weighted model counting, projected model counting, and weighted projected model counting.

The source codes of this software are based on those of MiniSat-based Sat solver [Glucose 3.0](https://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/) and [SharpSAT](https://github.com/marcthurley/sharpSAT) 12.08.1.
And also, inspired by [sharpSAT-TD](https://github.com/Laakeri/sharpsat-td), the current version incorporates 
a preprocessor for simplifying input formulas, and uses tree decomposition in decision heuristics. 
In the implementation, we use a part of source files of the preprocessor in sharpSAT-TD, and use [FlowCutter](https://github.com/kit-algo/flow-cutter-pace17) for tree decomposition.

## Installation
See `INSTALL.md`.

## Usage
```
$ ./gpmc [options] [file]
```
Options:

-  -mode=<0..3>
    - 0 : Model Counting
    - 1 : Weighted Model Counting
    - 2 : Projected Model Counting
    - 3 : Weighted Projected Model Counting 

-  -ddnnf  / -no-ddnnf  
	construct a d-DNNF with a variable mapping (default: off).  
	The d-DNNF is for the CNF simplified by the preprocessor.  
	The information about the correspondence between the input and simplified CNF is maintained.

-  -nnfout=\<string\>  
	write a constructed d-DNNF to the specified file when -ddnnf is set (default: no file output). 
    The variable correpondance 

-  -natw / -no-natw  
    use mpz_class as the internal data type for weights when weighted model counting (default: off, use mpfr::mpreal).  
    Note that we must give natual number weights for each literals in an input file (like "c p weight 1 2 0").

-  -prec=\<1..intmax>  
    set the precision of floating-point numbers (default: 15).

-  -cs=\<1..intmax>  
    set maximum component cache size (MB) (default: 4000)  
    NOTE: This bound is only for component cache. GPMC may use much more memory.

## Input file format
Input boolean formulas should be in DIMACS CNF format, together with additional information, weights and projection variables.
GPMC supports the [MCC2021 format](https://mccompetition.org/assets/files/2021/competition2021.pdf). 

Example:

```
p cnf 3 4
c p show 2 3 0
c p weight 2 0.6 0
c p weight -2 0.4 0
-1 2 0
-2 3 0
2 -3 0
1 -2 3 0
```
The set of projection variables is { 2, 3 }.
The weight of the positive literal of var 2 is 0.6, and that of the negative one is 0.4.
